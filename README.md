# Script_for_Extracellular-Vesicles-altered-by-Per--and-Polyfluoroalkyl-Substance-Mixtures

This script was generated to support the identification of differentially expressed microRNAs in isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) from HepG2 cells treated with a PFAS mixture in comparison to a control group contained within the manuscript:

Extracellular Vesicles altered by a Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Mixture: In Vitro Dose-Dependent Release, Chemical Content, and MicroRNA Signatures involved in Liver Health.

**Experiment_1-** This analysis identifies differentially expressed miRNA using the DESeq2 package. Only miRNA that were expressed above the overall median in at least 20% of samples were evaluated for differential expression. R script and a markdown file are provided along with all necessary inputs.
