# Script_for_Extracellular-Vesicles-altered-by-Per--and-Polyfluoroalkyl-Substance-Mixtures
Script that associates with Extracellular Vesicles altered by Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Mixtures: In Vitro Dose-Dependent Release, Chemical Content, and MicroRNA Signatures involved in Liver Health


Script in this repository was developed to identify differentially expressed miRNA in isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) from HepG2 cells treated with a PFAS mixture in comparison to a control group.

**Experiment_1-** This analysis identifies differentially expressed miRNA using the DESeq2 package. Only miRNA that were expressed above the overall median in at least 20% of samples were evaluated for differential expression.
